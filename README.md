##  Project Journey – 5 Slightly Stressful Stages

###  Stage 0: Finding a Business  
**Convince the owner to give you their entire business. Just kidding (kind of).**

This step is all about finding a business that:
- Is willing to give an interview 
- Will let you take pictures of the site 
- Has data they’re willing to share  
- Doesn’t mind you asking awkward questions for weeks  

Good luck. You’ll need it.

Define your problem, goals, methods, and timeline. Keep it sharp, honest, and professional.

###  Stage 2: Mid-Term Report

#### TA Comments on my Proposal

*The Executive Summary lacks details on how data will be collected, as well as the specific tools and techniques that will be used for analysis. Also, avoid using numbers (1, 2, 3) in this section for better readability. Avoid using the first person in sentences. The 'Organization Background' section describes Sham's personal history rather than presenting the farm as an organization. It should focus on key details like revenue, expenses, and production capacity instead of Sham's background. The report repeatedly uses "Sham" in an informal manner, which reduces its professionalism. Instead of directly referring to Sham in every sentence, use more formal and structured phrasing. For example, replace "Sham spends too much on watering his crops" with "The farm incurs high irrigation costs." The Problem-Solving Approach section lacks clarity in explaining the specific analysis techniques that will be used to address the identified problems. While cost tracking is mentioned, it does not specify whether cost-benefit analysis, trend analysis, or correlation analysis will be applied. Each problem should have a clear explanation of the method used to address it, ensuring a more structured and actionable analysis. The data collection process is vague as it only lists expense categories without specifying the sources of data or the method of collection. It is unclear how the farm's financial data is maintained—whether Sham records expenses in a register, maintains digital records, or relies on memory. Furthermore, the data collection period is missing—will it cover a single cropping cycle or multiple years for better trend assessment?*

#### TA Comments on my **The** Mid-Term Report

*Hello, LITESH. Your report has been evaluated, and it has been accepted. These are my observations: 1.The executive summary is fine, but it would be better if you included the data collection period, analysis method, and outcomes. 2.Your business is unorganised, so it has accepted but provided proof is below average. 3.The metadata and descriptive statistics are fine. 4.• Figs 1, 2, and 3 are meaningless. You need to mention the percentage of each item. 5.In Fig. 4, the Y-axis does not have an axis name. 6. Fig. 5 is not needed. This information is presented in Fig. 6. 7.You need hard work in your final report. All graphs should be properly labelled with data. You have taken four problems in the proposal, so all these problems should be address*
